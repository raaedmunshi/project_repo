## Featured Projects

### 1. Efficacy of Transformer Models on Colorectal Gland Segmentation (in the Semantic-Segmentation-of-Glands repo)

**Description**: 
Implemented semantic segmentation models, including Deeplabv3 with a Resnet101 backbone, Segformer, SwinUNetR, and UNetR, to evaluate the efficacy of transformers in colorectal gland segmentation compared to CNN architectures. The models were tested on colorectal gland datasets to compare their performance in accurately segmenting glandular structures. The results demonstrated that transformer-based models, such as Segformer and SwinUNetR, provided good potential in segmentation accuracy and robustness over traditional CNN-based models, highlighting their guarantee for enhanced precision in medical image analysis. This advancement can lead to more accurate diagnostics and better treatment planning in colorectal cancer care.

**Languages and Libraries**: Python with Pytorch and cv2, pandas,scikit-Learn, and numpy packages

### 2. Mosquito Susceptibility to Insecticides Classification Using Bioassay Results

**Description**: 
Developed a model to classify the resistance status of malaria-causing mosquitoes to various insecticides using machine learning techniques. We used machine learning models like Decision Trees, KNN, SVM Linear and Non-Linear, and Naive Bayes. We examined factors like insecticide type, class, concentration, environmental conditions (country and year), and mosquito characteristics (species and number) during bioassay. To ensure data quality, we've filtered out null values and inconsistencies in insecticide concentration and applied MinMax scaling for normalization. Analyzing class distributions, we've experimented with methods to handle imbalances, finding stratified sampling with oversampling and undersampling to be the best approach, yielding a decision tree model with 70.0% accuracy using random forest feature importance for feature selection, and achieving similar results without feature selection and using PCA.

**Languages and Libraries used**: Python with scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib,and seaborn

### 3. Weed Detection using EfficientViT

**Description**: 
Implemented and evaluated the deep learning model EfficientViT for weed detection solutions, focusing on its ability to handle small mask areas in semantic segmentation tasks. The model was tested on sugarbeet and sunflower datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying and segmenting weeds within these crops. By achieving high precision in detecting small and intricate weed patterns, the project highlights the potential of EfficientViT in improving agricultural efficiency and crop management. This solution could lead to more targeted weed control, reducing the need for herbicides and promoting sustainable farming practices.

**Languages and Libraries used**: Python with Pytorch packages

### 4. Efficacy of Sensor Readings in NASA Jet Engines

**Description**: 
Implemented machine learning models to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of NASA jet engines based on sensor readings, using Generalized Additive Model (GAM), LSTM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The models were evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) values, with LSTM providing the highest R2 value of 91%. Key factors affecting RUL included temperature, pressure, and vibration sensor readings. The project demonstrated the potential for predictive maintenance, enhancing engine longevity and operational efficiency in the aerospace industry.

**Languages Used**: R 

### 5. Contacts Application

**Description**: 
Developed an interactive contact list program with a GUI that allows users to manage their contacts through a visually intuitive interface. Users can add, remove, import, and export contacts efficiently. The program includes components like text fields, buttons, and tables to display and interact with contact information.

**Languages used**: Java

### 6. University Registration System

**Description**: 
Designed and implemented a university database system that keeps track of records of students and faculty of courses teaching and taking using the graphical user interface (GUI) in Java and established a client-server framework with a SQL Server which stores the records.

**Languages used**: SQL & Java
